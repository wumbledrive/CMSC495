## Test Plan

### <a name="introduction">Introduction</a>
The purpose of this documentation is to define the perimeters and metrics in which Valhalla’s Finest will be tested. This documentation will clearly define the roles and responsibilities that each team member will acquire as well as the manner in which the test will be conducted. With the publication of this documentation, we will ensure that testing will be conducted in a uniform, efficient, and precise manner. This will ensure that the player will receive the best gaming experience and that no critical fault will occur.

### <a name="approach"> Approach</a>
Testing for Valhalla’s Finest will be conducted in three phases. These phases are subject to change from the Lead Designer or the Project Manager.

* **Phase 1**: Test Cases will be identified by the Test Lead. The Test Lead will document the test cases and assign it to a tester. Once he has assigned all test cases to testers, the Test Lead will proceed his test team to phase 2.

* **Phase 2**: During this phase, all test cases will be tested against with all results being documented. If there are any failures, the Test Lead will have an addition tester test that test case and confirm. Once all testing has concluded the Test Lead will transition his team to phase 3.

* **Phase 3**: During this phase the Test Lead, with the assistance of the testers, will draft a final test report. The final test document will outline all the results from each test case. Additionally, any road block or issues that arose will be annotated in the final test report. Once the report is finalized, it will be passed over to the Lead Designer and Project Manager. This will conclude the testing cycle.

* **Phase 4 (*Optional*)**: If there are any changes to the program, testing will need to be conducted again. In which case phase 1 – 3 will be followed.

### <a name="responsibilities">Responsibilities </a>

Roles and responsibilities are the following:
* Project Manager – Roger Manga
* Lead Designer – Sean Donovan
* Test Lead - Andres Giraldo
* Tester - Jesse Nelson
* Tester - Nicholas Troyer
* Tester - Samuel Hoffman

The Test Lead will identify which tester will be assigned to specific test cases in order to properly manage the test results. 

If desired, the Test Lead can have multiple testers conduct independent tests of the same test case in order to ensure testing outcome. 

Once the testing phase has begun, no modifications will be done to the program until testing has concluded. 

At that time the Test Lead will report to the Lead Designer his finding from the test. 

Additional testing for a specific test case can be identified by the Lead Designer or the Project Manager.

### <a name="testingcriteria">Testing Criteria</a>

For the duration of the testing on our program, each test case will be tested and given one of three grading classifications:

**Pass** – This will be given if the test case meets or exceeds the expected outcome.

**Fail** – This will be given if the test case does not perform desired actions. Results can come from no action being performed or a critical failure to the overall program.

**Warning** – This will be given if the test case performed the desired action but an undesired effect also occurred.

### <a name="testingenvironment">Testing Environment</a>

For the purpose of testing this program, the following environmental perimeters have been configured:
```
Operating System: Windows
Hardware: At least 2 GB RAM, 2.5 GHz processor
Supporting Software: Visual Studio C++
```
If this program is ran in an environment not similar to that of testing, results can not be guaranteed. For the best playing experience, mirroring the testing environment is ideal. If for some reason the testing environment becomes unusable, testing will be paused and the environment will be rebuilt to the prescribed specification. If testing is paused, only the Test Lead can resume testing with the current test case being re-tested.
